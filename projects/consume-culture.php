				<div class="project-info__center">Consumerism is occupying more and more space in the western world. The consumerist society has made us feel that happiness comes from having things — material goods. Making extravagant purchases on shoes, shirts, hats, or fast food, directly affects you in the moment— ignoring the long run. What you value or what we value is key to how we want to live our lives. If we constantly live in the now, we will never get what we want tomorrow.</div>

				<div class="bdy bdy__h">Statement</div>
				<div class="bdy bdy__c">How might we help the general public realize their over-investment in material goods? It is a look towards minimalism. Removing the noise from your life — the space you fill with empty goods with of zero value, unless someone says it has it. <br>You have to question the value of the contents you own and continue to buy — <i>Do you <b>Really</b> need this?</i>The objective we hope to push with this campaign, is self-realizations. Acknowledging that you, as an individual are putting material objects, labeled as high value, before yourself.</div>

				<div class="bdy bdy__h">Concept</div>
				<div class="bdy bdy__c">In order for individuals to realize that what they are doing is crazy, they have to be caught in the act of what they are doing. With online shopping and the floating idea of — <i>I'm going to miss out on this limited offer/product</i> — you get a massive influx of individuals struggling to purchase items.<br> Posing as an Online Store, we can trick individuals into believing that the content on the site is real an available, however, once they try to go through the process to purchase an item, the user is prompted with a new window. The user gets caught red handed.<br> Individuals will reflect on their spending habits, getting them to question themselves 'Are Material objects worth what they believe it is worth' — are they overvaluing it? How much of their time is committed to indulgence of material goods?By asking these questions, the user is reassessing their emotional values as well as their monetary ones. Their emotional alignment should be with themselves, as they are also one of the victims of consumerism culture.</div>

				<div class="bdy bdy__c">We decided to rip off other brands, getting their logos, and putting our name on them. This included many of the popular consumer brands we see today, like: Nike, Adidas, Supreme, McDonalds, Costco, and Walmart. The idea is to sell clothing with the word "Consume" replacing the brand names, but styled using the same look. </div>
